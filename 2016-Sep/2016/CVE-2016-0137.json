            "text": "<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Click-to-Run (C2R) components handle objects in memory, which could lead to an Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.</p>\n<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the information disclosure vulnerability could use the obtained information to bypass the ASLR security mechanism in Windows, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The ASLR bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could leverage the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.</p>\n<p>To exploit the ASLR bypass, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. Workstations are primarily vulnerable to the potential ASLR bypass.\nThe security update addresses the ASLR bypass by correcting how C2R components handle memory addresses.</p>\n",

Why am I being offered this update?</strong>\nWhen updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.</p>\n<p>For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Products table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Products table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Products table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Products table.</p>\n<p>For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335\">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335</a>.
