An attacker would first have to extract the AES encryption key from the affected keyboard device. The attacker would also need to maintain physical proximity – within wireless range – of the devices for the duration of the attack.</p>\n<p>An attacker could use the vulnerability to inject arbitrary keyboard HID packets into a keyboard's dongle. For example, an attacker could simulate keystrokes to send malicious commands into a victim's computer. An attacker could also read keystrokes such as passwords sent by other keyboards for the affected devices.</p>\n<p>The update enhances security by mandating unique AES encryption keys are generated for each wireless keyboard device.</p>\n",
