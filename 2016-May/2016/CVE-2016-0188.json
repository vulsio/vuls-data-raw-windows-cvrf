The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass Device Guard UMCI policies.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user could either visit a malicious website or an attacker with access to the system could run a specially crafted application. An attacker could then leverage the vulnerability to run unsigned malicious code as though it were signed by a trusted source.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Internet Explorer validates UMCI policies.</p>\n",

Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?</strong>\nYes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. EnhancedÂ Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.</p>\n<p><strong>Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?</strong>\nYes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>For more information about EMET, see the <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751\">Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit</a>.</p>\n",
