						"text": "<p><strong>NOTE</strong> This advisory was revised on July 10, 2018. Some content has been removed for simplicity and because it is no longer relevant. You can view the archived content for ADV180002 in the FAQ section following the Affected Products table.</p>\n<h1>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Microsoft is aware of a new publicly disclosed class of vulnerabilities referred to as “speculative execution side-channel attacks” that affect many modern processors and operating systems including Intel, AMD, and ARM. Note: this issue will affect other systems such as Android, Chrome, iOS, MacOS, so we advise customers to seek out guidance from those vendors.</p>\n<p>An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has released updates to help mitigate these vulnerabilities. To get all available protections, firmware (microcode) and software updates are required. This may include microcode from device OEMs and in some cases updates to AV software as well. In some cases, installing these updates will have a performance impact. We have also taken action to secure our cloud services.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has no information to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been used to attack customers at this time. Microsoft continues working closely with industry partners including chip makers, hardware OEMs, and app vendors to protect customers.</p>\n<p>This advisory addresses the following vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVE-2017-5753 - Bounds check bypass</li>\n<li>CVE-2017-5715 - Branch target injection</li>\n<li>CVE-2017-5754 - Rogue data cache load</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Recommended Actions</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>The best protection is to keep computers up to date. Please see <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073757/protect-your-windows-devices-against-spectre-meltdown\">Knowledge Base Article 4073757</a> for guidance on protecting Windows devices. Customers using Surface products should see <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073065/surface-surface-hub-update-history\">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4073065</a>.</li>\n<li>Enterprise customers are recommended to review this advisory in detail and register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory.  See <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948\">Microsoft Technical Security Notifications</a>.</li>\n<li>Software developers should review the C++ developer guidance for speculative execution side channels at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/sescdevguide\">https://aka.ms/sescdevguide</a>.</li>\n<li>Verify the status of protections for CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5754 using the PowerShell script Get-SpeculationControlSettings. For more information and to obtain the PowerShell script see: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074629/understanding-the-output-of-get-speculationcontrolsettings-powershell\">Understanding Get-SpeculationControlSettings PowerShell script output</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Potential performance impacts</h2>\n<p>In testing Microsoft has seen some performance impact with these mitigations. For most consumer devices, the impact may not be noticeable; however, the specific impact varies by hardware generation and implementation by the chip manufacturer. Microsoft values the security of its software and services and has made the decision to implement certain mitigation strategies in an effort to better secure our products. In some cases, mitigations are not enabled by default to allow users and administrators to evaluate the performance impact and risk exposure before deciding to enable the mitigations. We continue to work with hardware vendors to improve performance while maintaining a high level of security.</p>\n<h1>Advisory Details</h1>\n<h2>Vulnerabilities Description</h2>\n<p>Speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities can be used to read the content of memory across a trusted boundary and can therefore lead to information disclosure. There are multiple vectors by which an attacker could trigger the vulnerabilities depending on the configured environment. For a detailed view of affected scenarios and Microsoft’s approach to mitigating this new class of vulnerabilities, please see our <a href=\"https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2018/03/15/mitigating-speculative-execution-side-channel-hardware-vulnerabilities/\">Security Research Blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the CVEs, names, and affected processors for each of these vulnerabilities:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CVE</th>\n<th>Public Vulnerability Name</th>\n<th>Other Names</th>\n<th>Processors Affected</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CVE-2017-5753</td>\n<td>Bounds check bypass</td>\n<td>Spectre, Variant 1</td>\n<td>AMD, ARM, Intel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CVE-2017-5715</td>\n<td>Branch target injection</td>\n<td>Spectre, Variant 2</td>\n<td>AMD, ARM, Intel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CVE-2017-5754</td>\n<td>Rogue data cache load</td>\n<td>Meltdown, Variant 3</td>\n<td>ARM, Intel</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The first two variants, Bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753) and Branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715) are collectively known as Spectre. An attacker who has successfully exploited these vulnerabilities may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run untrusted code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities. In browsing scenarios, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious site to leverage these vulnerabilities to privileged information from the browser process such as sensitive data from other opened tabs. An attacker could also inject malicious code into advertising networks used by trusted sites or embed malicious code on a compromised, but trusted, site. Bounds check bypass store is an extension of Bounds check bypass.</p>\n<p>The third variant, Rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754) is known as Meltdown. An attacker who has successfully exploited this vulnerability may be able to read privileged memory from an unprivileged context.

What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?</strong></p>\n<p>These vulnerabilities are information disclosure vulnerabilities. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could use them to leak sensitive information that could be used for further exploitation of the system. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run untrusted code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities. In browsing scenarios, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious site to leverage these vulnerabilities. An attacker could also inject malicious code into advertising networks used by trusted sites or embed malicious code on a compromised, but trusted, site.</p>\n<p>By themselves, these vulnerabilities do not allow arbitrary code execution.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Is my device protected after I’ve applied the Windows security updates Microsoft released on January 3, 2018?</strong></p>\n<p>To get all available protections for your device(s) against the three vulnerabilities described in this advisory, you must install the security updates for Windows and apply microcode updates provided by your hardware OEM.</p>\n<p>If your OEM does not provide a microcode update, or if you are unable to apply it, the Windows security updates released on January 3, 2018 alone address:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVE-2017-5753 - Bounds check bypass</li>\n<li>CVE-2017-5754 - Rogue data cache load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To address CVE-2017-5715 - Branch target injection, you must apply a microcode update in conjunction with the Windows security update. Any questions regarding microcode updates must be directed to your OEM. Systems without updated microcode remain vulnerable to information disclosure as described in FAQ 8: What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?</p>\n<p><strong>10. I have an AMD-based device and compatible antivirus software, but I am not getting the January 2018 Windows Security Update. Why is that?</strong></p>\n<p>Microsoft worked with AMD to resolve update blocks on a small subset of older AMD processors (that were previously blocked to avoid users getting into an unbootable state after installation of recent Windows operating system security updates). As of January 18, 2018, Microsoft has resumed updating all AMD devices with the Windows operating system security update to help protect against the <a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002\">chipset vulnerabilities</a> known as Spectre and Meltdown. The following Windows operating system update KBs include information on how to get the update.

Intel has identified reboot issues with microcode on some older processors. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>Intel has <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-security-issue-update-addressing-reboot-issues/\">reported issues</a> with recently released microcode meant to address Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715 Branch Target Injection) – specifically Intel noted that this microcode can cause “<a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news/root-cause-of-reboot-issue-identified-updated-guidance-for-customers-and-partners/\">higher than expected reboots and other unpredictable system behavior</a>” and then noted that situations like this may result in “<a href=\"https://www.intc.com/investor-relations/investor-education-and-news/investor-news/press-release-details/2018/Intel-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2017-Financial-Results/default.aspx\">data loss or corruption</a>.” Our own experience is that system instability can in some circumstances cause data loss or corruption. On January 22nd Intel recommended that customers <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news/root-cause-of-reboot-issue-identified-updated-guidance-for-customers-and-partners/\">stop deploying the current microcode version</a> on impacted processors while they perform additional testing on the updated solution. We understand that Intel is continuing to investigate the potential impact of the current microcode version and encourage customers to review their guidance on an ongoing basis to inform their decisions.</p>\n<p>While Intel tests, updates, and deploys new microcode, we are making available an out of band update today, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/help/4078130\">KB4078130</a>, that specifically disables only the mitigation against CVE 2017-5715 - Branch Target Injection vulnerability. In our testing this update has been found to prevent the behavior described. For the full list of devices, see <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/microcode-update-guidance.pdf\">Intel’s microcode revision guidance</a>. This update covers Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 8.1, and all versions of Windows 10, for client and server. If you are running an impacted device, this update can be applied by downloading it from the <a href=\"http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4078130\">Microsoft Update Catalog</a>. Application of this payload specifically disables only the mitigation against CVE 2017-5715 - Branch Target Injection vulnerability.</p>\n<p>As of January 25, there are no known reports to indicate that this Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715) has been used to attack customers. We recommend Windows customers, when appropriate, re-enable the mitigation against CVE-2017-5715 when Intel reports that this unpredictable system behavior has been resolved for your device.</p>\n<p><strong>Update April 24, 2018:</strong></p>\n<p>Microsoft has released stand-alone security update 4078407 that by default enables the mitigation against Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715) for all supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 10 Servers. This update can be applied by downloading it from the <a href=\"http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4078407\">Microsoft Update Catalog</a>.

If I have not installed the January 2018 Security Only updates or the February 2018 Security Only updates, what do I need to install to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this advisory?</strong></p>\n<p>Security Only updates are not cumulative. Depending on the operating system version you are running, you would need to install the January, February, and March Security Only Updates to be protected against the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. For example, if you are running Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems on an affected Intel CPU you need to install the January, February, and March Security Only Updates. We recommend installing these Security Only updates in the order of release. Note: an earlier version of this FAQ incorrectly stated that the February Security Only update included the security fixes released in January for the issues associated with this advisory.</p>\n<p><strong>13. If I apply any of the applicable February security updates, will they disable the protections for CVE-2017-5715 like security update 4078130 did?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Security update 4078130 was a specific fix to prevent unpredictable system behaviors, performance issues, and/or unexpected reboots after installation of microcode. Applying the February security updates on Windows client operating systems enables all three mitigations. On Windows server operating systems, you still need to enable the mitigations after proper testing is performed.
