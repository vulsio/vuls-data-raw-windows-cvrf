            "text": "<h1>Executive summary</h1>\n<p>On January 3, 2018, Microsoft released an advisory and security updates related to a newly-discovered class of hardware vulnerabilities (known as Spectre and Meltdown) involving speculative execution side channels that affect AMD, ARM, and Intel CPUs to varying degrees. On May 21st, a new subclass of speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities known as <em>Speculative Store Bypass (SSB)</em> has been announced and assigned <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3639\">CVE-2018-3639</a>.</p>\n<p>An attacker who has successfully exploited this vulnerability may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. Vulnerable code patterns in the operating system (OS) or in applications could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. In the case of Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers, such as JavaScript JIT employed by modern web browsers, it may be possible for an attacker to supply JavaScript that produces native code that could give rise to an instance of CVE-2018-3639. However, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and other major browsers have taken steps to increase the difficulty of successfully creating a side channel.</p>\n<p>At the time of publication, we are not aware of any exploitable code patterns of this vulnerability class in our software or cloud service infrastructure, but we are continuing to investigate. Microsoft will implement the following strategy to mitigate Speculative Store Bypass:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a vulnerable code pattern is found, we will address it with a security update.</li>\n<li>Microsoft Windows and Azure will add support for Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) as documented by <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00115.html\">Intel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/security-updates\">AMD</a>. SSBD inhibits a Speculative Store Bypass from occurring, thus eliminating the security risk completely. For Windows on ARM devices, OEMs will provide an update that will mitigate Speculative Store Bypass automatically as documented by <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability\">ARM</a>. This mitigation will be delivered via Windows Update.</li>\n<li>Microsoft will continue to develop, release, and deploy defense-in-depth mitigations for speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities including Speculative Store Bypass. See the <a href=\"Https://aka.ms/sescsrdssb\">Microsoft Security Research and Defense blog</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>Microsoft will continue to research speculative execution side channels, including through researcher outreach and the speculative execution bounty program. See <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/mt846432.aspx\">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/mt846432.aspx</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Recommended actions (updated November 13, 2018)</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Register for security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory.  See <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948\">Microsoft Technical Security Notifications</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the vulnerability details. See the <strong>References</strong> section for links to further information.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Microsoft recommends that developers review the updated developer guidance for Speculative Store Bypass at: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/security/developer-guidance-speculative-execution\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/security/developer-guidance-speculative-execution</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Apply updates as follows:</p>\n<p>4.1. Apply the Windows updates that provide support for SSBD. See the <strong>Security Updates</strong> table to download and install these updates.</p>\n<p>4.2. Hardware-specific action may be required in devices using certain processors:</p>\n<p>a. Intel processors: For a list of affected Intel processors see Intel's advisory <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00115.html\">here</a>. Apply hardware/microcode updates from your device OEM for affected Intel-based systems. Note that SSBD in Intel processors is dependent upon having the corresponding microcode installed. Contact your OEM for firmware/BIOS versions that contain SSBD compatibility.</p>\n<p>b. AMD processors: For a list of affected AMD processor families see AMD’s advisory <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/security-updates\">here</a>. Updated microcode is not required.</p>\n<p>c. ARM processors: For a list of affected ARM processors, see ARM’s advisory <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability\">here</a>. An OEM provided update will be delivered via Windows Update to mitigate Speculative Store Bypass automatically (enabled by default without option to disable). Contact your OEM for availability.</p>\n<p>4.3. Evaluate the performance implication of turning on SSBD in your environment.</p>\n<p>4.4. Evaluate the Speculative Store Bypass risk to your environment, including CVSS value and exposure to vulnerable code patterns in third-party software, and decide if SSBD should be turned on.</p>\n<p>4.5. To turn on SSBD, use the registry settings documented here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073119\">Windows Client Guidance for IT Pros to protect against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072698\">Windows Server guidance to protect against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.6. To verify the status of SSBD, the Get-SpeculationControlSettings PowerShell script has been updated to detect affected processors, status of the SSBD operating system updates, and state of the processor microcode if applicable.
